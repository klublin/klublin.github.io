      <description>Multithreaded program to allow communication between telephone units. Using the command utility Telnet, terminals were allowed to send messages to each other in order to faciliate communication. There was one central unit which created telephone units, where each unit was its own thread. Each unit handled creating its own sockets and accepting and binding on ports. Able to handle more than 30 connections at once.</description>
