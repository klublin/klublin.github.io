Hi I'm Kevin Wei and welcome to my website. I am a Junior at Stony Brook majoring in Computer Science and Economics. My current interests in Computer Science lie in Cloud Computing, specifically scalability and architecture design, Systems level programming and Software Engineering. I am currently looking for internships in any of these areas for the summer of 2023. If you have any opportunities in these fields please contact me. Thank you and enjoy my site!
